# ROS Tooling Repository Configurations

This repository contains common resources for configuration of `ros-tooling` repositories, as well as the workflows to automatically apply desired configurations to the managed repos.
It attemps to implement the design at https://github.com/ros-tooling/design/blob/main/docs/github-repository-management.md

## Features
